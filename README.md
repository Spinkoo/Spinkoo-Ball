# Spinkoo-Ball
A simple game made for improving your aim precision using BOX2D / javascript 


Spinkoo ball is a simple game made to improve you aim & also so you HAVE FUUN :D 

The rules of the game are simple : 

1-You have to eliminate the maximum number of boxes with the minimum number of balls

2-Balls are used to eliminate the boxes before they fall ( once a box falls out of the pit is no coming back )

3-Throwing a ball is easy all you have to do is to left click (inside the pit ) and a ball is going to be thrown in the side you choosed 

4-In order for a ball to eliminate a box it has to be infected which means : * It has to be touched by another ball *

5-If a ball is infected & it gets touched by another ball the previous ball get BIGGER giving you more chances to elimante more than one box at a time 

6-Touching a box directly with a ball doesn't elimante the box ( ie when the ball ain't infected )

7-If the pit is full you lose the game :)
